## üîç How It Works

### Recommendation Pipeline

```
Base Pathway ‚Üí Identify Electives ‚Üí Match Catalogs ‚Üí Filter Prerequisites
                                                              ‚Üì
                                           Score & Rank ‚Üê Apply Keywords
                                                              ‚Üì
                                           Top 5 Selections ‚Üí Add to Roadmap
```

### Elective Type Detection

The engine automatically detects elective types using pattern matching:

| Elective Name Pattern                             | Matched Catalog                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| "Natural Science", "SCL", "with lab"              | `sciences_with_lab.json`       |
| "Computer Science Elective", "Technical Elective" | `comp_courses.json`            |
| "Arts and Humanities", "(AH"                      | `arts_humanities_courses.json` |
| "Social Sciences", "(SS"                          | `social_sciences_courses.json` |
| "Free Elective"                                   | All relevant catalogs          |

### Prerequisite Validation

The engine respects:

- ‚úÖ Course prerequisites (e.g., COMP.1010 required before COMP.2010)
- ‚úÖ Standing requirements (Junior/Senior standing)
- ‚úÖ Major restrictions (Majors only)
- ‚ùå Courses requiring instructor permission (filtered out)

## üéØ Configuration Tips

### Keyword Strategy

**High Weights (8-10):**

- Core technologies/skills for the career
- Must-have competencies

**Medium Weights (5-7):**

- Complementary skills
- Secondary technologies

**Low Weights (1-4):**

- Nice-to-have skills
- Tangentially related topics

**Negative Keywords:**

- Topics that would mislead recommendations
- Completely irrelevant subjects
- Courses that waste elective slots

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific:** Use exact technical terms (e.g., "react" not just "web")
2. **Balance Weights:** Don't make everything weight 10
3. **Test Iterations:** Generate ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Adjust ‚Üí Repeat
4. **Use Negative Keywords:** Prevent obviously wrong recommendations
5. **Consider Context:** General ed keywords should support career soft skills

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No Recommendations Generated

**Symptoms:** Elective slots remain empty after running generator

**Solutions:**

1. Check that keywords match course descriptions (case-insensitive)
2. Verify catalog files are properly loaded
3. Ensure negative keywords aren't too broad
4. Review prerequisite requirements (may be filtering out all candidates)

### Irrelevant Recommendations

**Symptoms:** Suggested courses don't match career goals

**Solutions:**

1. Add negative keywords to filter out unwanted topics
2. Increase weights for more specific technical keywords
3. Review and adjust keyword definitions in `config.json`
4. Check catalog matching logic in `get_catalogs_for_elective()`

### Missing Elective Detection

**Symptoms:** Engine doesn't recognize certain elective slots

**Solutions:**

1. Add pattern matching in `get_catalogs_for_elective()` function
2. Verify elective naming convention in base pathway files
3. Check for typos in course names
